# For-Chriss-Cousin
Hey so, this code will be in C++ instead of C, but I have outlined the syntax changes. Although it has been LONG TIME since I've used C, but if you understand what the code is 
saying, you should be able to write your own code in C by just changing the syntax to match with C's standards.  Just click on "Llama population project" to view the code. If you have any questions with what I wrote, just text Chris about it, and he'll ask me from there. Good luck with school and have fun coding!
